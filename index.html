                A Few Sentences About Me...
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                I am a student of International Information Systems at FAU Nuremberg. 
                Previously I graduated with a B.A. in Politics and Economics from the University of Münster. 
                During internships in Data and Management consulting I learned how to leverage information 
                technology to accelerate operations. 
                Currently, I am expanding on my passion for technology and programming. I am looking forward to the 
                challenges ahead.

                    <p>To tailor the studies to my interests, I specialized in statistics 
                        for economics and social sciences and digitization topics. As part of this, 
                        I took courses in advanced statistics and econometrics, which included programming work in R. 
                        Further I took seminars focused on digitalization and energy economics.

                        In addition, I am deepening my knowledge in Python and the AI library PyTorch while taking a 
                        class about the development of computer vision systems. Further I am expanding my view on knowledge 
                        management and global project management.

                        vivid presentations and effectively communicated my findings. Other aspects focused on further topics of change 
                        management. At Capgemini Invent, I was able to expand my experience in working with data, in project management, and
